# PROJECT-MapIt
The project is a Google Maps clone. 
The project focuses on providing all the possible routes between two locations along with:
1. Distance between them.
2. Time taken to cover the distance.(ignoring the traffic)

The project displays a map that is loaded on the website using a third party service.
By default the current position of the user is marked on the map.
The machine enables us to:
 1. Search different locations.
 2. Access different styles of Maps.
 3. Add mid-points between two locations
